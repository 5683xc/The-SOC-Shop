# The-SOC-Shop
Repository of scripts/tools that may be useful in Security Operations Centres (SOC)

This is just a simple collection of scripts, bits and pieces and general stuff that we have found useful for day to day use in the Selex-ES Archangel SOC.

Let me know if you find errors or have better ways to do something. For the most part these are just scripts or tools to get the job done, they may not be pretty but with a bit of tinkering they should save some time in the long run.
